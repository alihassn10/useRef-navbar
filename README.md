# useRef Navbar Demo

This repository contains a demo application showcasing the usage of the `useRef` hook to create a responsive navigation bar. You can view the live demo of the application [here](https://temp-useref-navbar.netlify.app/).

The `useRef` hook is a built-in hook in React that provides a way to access and interact with the DOM elements directly. In this demo, we utilize the `useRef` hook to manage the navigation bar behavior and responsiveness without the need for additional state management.
